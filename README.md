Design and Implementation of a Fully Differential 6th-Order Sallen-Key Active Low-Pass Filter

- Overview
  This project presents the design and simulation of a fully differential 6th-order Sallen-Key active low-pass filter tailored for wideband wireless communication systems. The design emphasizes high linearity,      low power consumption, and robust common-mode noise rejection, making it suitable for integration in analog baseband signal processing.

- Objectives
    Implement a 6th-order Butterworth filter using three cascaded 2nd-order Sallen-Key stages.

    Achieve a closed-loop gain of 1 V/V with a 20 MHz bandwidth.

    Ensure high Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR > 60 dB) and group delay < 30 ns.

    Design for integration in a TSMC 65nm CMOS process with a 1.2 V supply.


- Design Phases
    Phase I â€“ Folded OTA Design: Creation and simulation of a folded operational transconductance amplifier.

    Phase II â€“ 2nd-Order Stage Design: Design of individual second-order Sallen-Key stages using equal R methodology.
  
    Phase III â€“ Cascaded Architecture: Integration of three identical 2nd-order stages to form the complete 6th-order low-pass filter.

    Common-Mode Feedback (CMFB): Initial testing with an ideal CMFB block, to be replaced with a real implementation in future work.


- Simulation Results
    AC Analysis: Verified gain flatness within <1 dB ripple, attenuation >55 dBc at 10Ã— the cutoff frequency.

    Transient Analysis: Demonstrated stable response to input step signals with minimal overshoot and acceptable settling times.

    Group Delay: Maintained flat delay across the passband, supporting wideband signal fidelity.
